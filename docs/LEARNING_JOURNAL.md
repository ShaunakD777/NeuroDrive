### 2026-10-10 — Planning
- Concept: one environment, three feedback channels (teacher labels, episode summary, step reward).
- Key idea: loss, fitness and reward are different objectives; only the Driving Exam is compared
  across methods.
- Open question: which method will generalise best to held-out tracks, and why?

### 2026-10-10 — Task 0.1 Python project skeleton
- Concept: a package (importable folder), a virtual environment (private Python + libraries in
  `.venv/`), a lock file (exact versions of everything installed), a test runner, and an entry
  point that turns a function into the `nd` terminal command.
- Key equation(s) in words: none, plumbing task.
- What we observed: `uv sync` downloaded its own Python 3.12 even though the system has 3.11, and
  wrote `uv.lock`; pytest found and passed 1 test; `nd --help` lists the `version` subcommand.
- Surprise or difficulty: a Typer app with a single command collapses into that command, so a
  callback is needed to keep `nd` a group of subcommands. Ruff 0.17 also checks Python code
  blocks inside Markdown files.
- Open question: `pyproject.toml` says what we want, `uv.lock` says what we got — how strict
  should we be about upgrading the lock, given that results must stay reproducible?

### 2026-10-10 — Task 0.2 Seeded randomness module
- Concept: a pseudo-random generator follows a fixed recipe set by its seed; each sub-component
  gets its own named child stream so changing one never shifts another.
- Key equation(s) in words: child stream = f(master seed, family-tree position, name). It does
  not depend on how many numbers the parent has produced or on the order children are requested.
- What we observed: seed 42 gives 0.774, 0.439, 0.859 every time; seed 43 gives 0.652, 0.044,
  0.020; the child "init" of seed 42 gives 0.890, 0.832, 0.118 even after the parent has drawn
  1000 numbers. A planted `np.random.rand` in the source was caught by the scan test.
- Surprise or difficulty: asking twice for the same child name returns identical streams, by
  design; a component must keep its child, not re-ask. Also, one test I first wrote could not
  fail, so it was removed: a test must be able to fail to prove anything.
- Open question: when evolution runs many seeds in parallel processes, how will each worker
  get its generator without sharing state?
